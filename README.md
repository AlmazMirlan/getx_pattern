## A proposal to standardize your development with GetX.  

>**Objective**  
> - Facilitate the learning of the package.  
> - Have a solid, standard structure for developing applications with GetX.  
> - Facilitate the use of GetX in an organized, simple and scalable way.  
> - Facilitate the search for information and dissemination of knowledge.  
> - Working in the English version and new site multi-language.  
  
#### [Documentation in Portuguese at GitHub Pages](https://kauemurakami.github.io/getx_pattern/)  
#### Also try our extension for vscode [GetX Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=get-snippets.get-snippets) thinking 100% about **getx_pattern**, it will greatly speed up your development process with [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get).

### Structure in modules
```yaml
- /app  
# This is where all the application's directories will be contained  
    - /modules
    # Each module consists of a page, its respective GetXController and its dependencies or Bindings.
    # We treat each screen as an independent module, as it has its only controller, and can also contain its dependencies.
    # If you use reusable widgets in this, and only in this module, you can choose to add a folder for them.
        - /my_module
            - my_page.dart
            - my_controller.dart
            - my_binding.dart
            - /local_widgets
    # The Binding class is a class that decouples dependency injection, while "binding" routes to the state manager and the dependency manager.
    # This lets you know which screen is being displayed when a specific controller is used and knows where and how to dispose of it.
    # In addition, the Binding class allows you to have SmartManager configuration control.
    # You can configure how dependencies are to be organized and remove a route from the stack, or when the widget used for disposition, or none of them.

    - /global_widgets 
    # Widgets that can be reused by multiple **modules**.  

    - /routes
    # In this repository we will deposit our routes and pages.  
    # We chose to separate into two files, and two classes, one being routes.dart, containing its constant routes and the other for routing.  
        - my_routes.dart
        # class Routes {
        # This file will contain your constants ex:  
        # class Routes { const HOME = '/ home'; }  
        - my_pages.dart
        # This file will contain your array routing ex :  
        # class AppPages { static final pages = [  
        #  GetPage(name: Routes.HOME, page:()=> HomePage()) 
        # ]};  

    - /theme
    #Here we can create themes for our widgets, texts and colors
        - text_theme.dart  
        # inside ex: final textTitle = TextStyle(fontSize: 30)  
        - color_theme.dart  
        # inside ex: final colorCard = Color(0xffEDEDEE)  
        - app_theme.dart  
        # inside ex: final textTheme = TextTheme(headline1: TextStyle(color: colorCard))  

- main.dart  
# main file
# proposed by william Silva 
# We also have a version in packages to vocvÃª that is used to the good old MVC

examples available in this repository: getx_pattern_site and getx_example
